The Fourier Transform decomposes signals into their fundamental frequency components.

It converts time-domain data (like audio waves) into frequency-domain representations, 
revealing hidden spectral patterns

But the regular fourier transform involves integrals
which are known to be the root of all evil and the bane of my existance.

Luckily the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm was co-discovered by James Cooley 
and John Tukey in 1965.
While the underlying ideas had been explored earlier, their work significantly streamlined
the algorithm and made it practical for use with digital computers. 
TLDR: ts cool af.
